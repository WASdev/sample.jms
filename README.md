# sample.jms11
Liberty JMS 1.1 sample

This sample project contains a simple JMS Servlet application called JMSSample. JMSSample listens for HTTP requests sent to `localhost:9124/jms11-JMSSample`, and responds with various actions.
There are 2 main Servlets that are contained:

1. P2P : Point-to-Point Messaging uses JMS Queue to send and receive messages.  It also contains MDB message send and response.

2. PubSub : Publish-and-Subscribe Messaging uses JMS topic to send and receive messages. 

## Running with Maven

This project can be build with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Set the `IBM_LIBERTY_LICENSE` environment property with the license code found in the Liberty license file. See the following [instructions][Liberty License Instructions] on obtaining the license code. 
    ```bash
    $ export IBM_LIBERTY_LICENSE=<license code>
    ```

2. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn -Pwlp clean install
    ```

Once the server is running, the Queue application actions will be available under :

[http://localhost:9124/jms11-JMSSample/JMSSampleP2P?ACTION=listAction](http://localhost:9124/jms11-JMSSample/JMSSampleP2P?ACTION=listAction).

the Topic application actions will be available under :

[http://localhost:9124/jms11-JMSSample/JMSSamplePubSub?ACTION=listAction](http://localhost:9124/jms11-JMSSample/JMSSamplePubSub?ACTION=listAction).

3. To stop the Liberty server, execute the following (Note: If you would like to re-install Liberty, first you must stop the Liberty sserver with this command, otherwise installation will fail:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:stop-server
    ```

4. To start the Liberty server, execute the following:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:start
    ```
